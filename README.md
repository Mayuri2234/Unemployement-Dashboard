•	Added calculated fields and prepared the dataset for import into Power BI.

•	Imported Excel data into Power BI for visualization and dashboard creation.

•	Created slicers for age, gender, region, and year for interactive filtering.

•	Designed charts (line, bar, pie, map) and KPIs to display key insights.

•	Published and tested the dashboard for clarity, usability, and insight delivery.

•  Age Group with Highest Unemployment:

    •	25–34 years: 95M (36.4%) — highest among all age groups.
    
•  Year with Maximum Unemployment:

    •	2010 — peak unemployment recorded.
    
•  Year with Minimum Unemployment:

    •	2015 — lowest unemployment during the observed period.

•	"Total Unemployed by Year and Gender" shows a sharp peak in 2010, followed by a steady decline until 2014.

## Project Conclusion
The dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of unemployment trends by age, gender, and year. It indicates that while unemployment peaked around 2010, experiencing a significant decline by 2014, men consistently represent a larger share of the unemployed population compared to women. Furthermore, the 25 to 34 years age group consistently shows the highest unemployment rates, highlighting a particular demographic most affected by joblessness.
